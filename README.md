## ✍️ Reflections

| No. | Assignment | Type | Reflection |
|----|------------|------|------------|
| 1 | **Assignment 1 – Industry Visit** | Video (YouTube) | This industry visit provided me with valuable exposure to how ICT services and digital systems are applied in a real organizational environment. Through the video, I was able to observe how technology supports daily operations, system management, and teamwork within an organization. I learned that effective collaboration, clear communication, and proper use of digital tools are essential for smooth workflow and service delivery. This assignment helped me connect theoretical knowledge learned in class with real-world industry practices, and it increased my awareness of how ICT professionals operate in an actual working environment. Overall, the industry visit enhanced my understanding of professional responsibilities and strengthened my interest in pursuing a career in the ICT field. |
| 2 | **Assignment 2 – Industry Talk 1 (Company)** | Poster / PNG | This industry talk exposed me to various ICT job roles and career opportunities available in the technology industry. Through the information shared by the company, I learned about the expectations of employers and the importance of having both strong technical skills and soft skills. The talk emphasized that skills such as communication, teamwork, adaptability, and problem-solving are just as important as programming knowledge. By summarizing the talk into a poster, I was able to identify key points and present industry information in a clear and concise manner. This assignment motivated me to start preparing early by improving my skills and building a strong foundation for my future career in the ICT industry. |
| 3 | **Assignment 3 – Industry Talk 2 (Company)** | Report (PDF) | This industry talk focused on project management and system development in real-world ICT projects. From this session, I gained deeper insights into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and the use of methodologies such as Agile in managing software projects. The speaker highlighted the importance of proper planning, requirement analysis, system design, and teamwork to ensure project success. I also learned that effective communication among team members is crucial in avoiding misunderstandings and system failures. Writing the report helped me reflect critically on the talk and understand how theoretical concepts taught in class are applied in industry settings. This assignment strengthened my understanding of system development processes and prepared me for future project-based work. |
| 4 | **Quiz / Lab – PC Assemble** | Lab Activity | Through the PC assembly lab activity, I learned practical skills related to computer hardware. I have learnt how to assemble and reassemble a PC. For instance, I now can take off the power supply, RAM, fan, and other internal components correctly and safely. This hands-on experience helped me understand the functions of each hardware component and how they work together to form a complete computer system. The activity highlighted the importance of hardware knowledge, especially for computer science students, as it complements software skills. This lab increased my confidence in handling computer hardware and gave me a better appreciation of the physical aspects of computing systems. |
| 5 | **Project – Design Thinking** | Project Report | The design thinking project enhanced my problem-solving, creativity, and teamwork skills. Through this project, I learned how to identify problems from a user-centered perspective and develop practical solutions based on user needs. The process encouraged brainstorming, idea evaluation, and collaboration among team members. I also learned the importance of clear communication and role distribution within a group to ensure project success. This project helped me understand how structured thinking and creativity can be combined in system development. Overall, the design thinking project improved my ability to work in teams and approach problems in a more systematic and innovative way. |
